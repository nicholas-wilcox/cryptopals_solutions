# Cryptopal Solutions

These are my solutions to the [Cryptopals Crypto Challenges](https://cryptopals.com/), implemented in [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/).

I chose Ruby because I wanted to learn another interpreted language by way of completing these challenges.
It feels like a hybridization of Python -- which I have some educational experience with but was not interested in using for this purpose --
and JavaScript -- which I already have professional experience with. Overall, I have been very pleased with Ruby's features, especially
its iteration, block arguments, and mixins, which allow me to write very succinct and expressive scripts.

Really, aside from getting practical experience with cryptography, I'm aiming to learn how to write good Ruby code in many ways:
succinct, aligned with common conventions, and organized in a way that befits the circumstances. I have attempted to follow the [Ruby Style Guide](https://rubystyle.guide/) throughout the project.
I have also used [RSpec](https://rspec.info/) to separate the code that *facilitates* the challenge from the code that actually *solves* the challenge.
