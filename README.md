# Cryptopal Solutions

These are my solutions to the [Cryptopals Crypto Challenges](https://cryptopals.com/), implemented in [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/).

I chose Ruby because I want to learn another interpreted language by way of completing these challenges.
It feels like a hybridization of Python -- which I have some educational experience with but was not interested in using for this purpose --
and JavaScript -- which I already have professional experience writing. Overall, I have been very pleased with Ruby's features, especially
it's iteration, block arguments, and mixins. They have enabled me to chisel away at a solution until I am truly satisfied with the code.

Really, aside from getting practical experience with cryptography, I'm aiming to learn how to write good Ruby code *on multiple scales*:
succinct, aligned with common conventions, and organized in a way that befits the circumstances. I have attempted to follow the [Ruby Style Guide](https://rubystyle.guide/)
in my code. I have also tried to separate the code that *sets up/facilitates* the challenge from the code that actually *solves* the challenge. To this end, I'm made use of
[RSpec](https://rspec.info/) in order to show my solutions.
